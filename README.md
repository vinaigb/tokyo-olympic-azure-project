# Data Engineering for Olympic data using Azure cloud services
The project focuses on a series of steps in the data engineering pipeline using Azure cloud services. The Azure Data factory was used to extract data from the source. The extracted data was stored on Azure Data Lake Gen 2.  The data was transformed using Pyspark in the Azure Databricks environment. The Azure Synapse Analytics was used to provide further insights using SQL scripts. The dashboard was finally built using Tableau.
